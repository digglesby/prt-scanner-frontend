# prtscanner.com website

This is the code to [the PRT scanner website](https://prtscanner.com) I built with Justin Reyolds using his PRT status scraper.

## What does it do?

This web front end loads historical data from https://api.prtscanner.com/stats and presents it through a responsive web interface with graphs using [Nivo](https://github.com/plouc/nivo)
